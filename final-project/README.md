####by Wilson Cordeiro - G00330453
A third year Data Representation and Querying Project 2015. 

###Overview
As required on the Data Representation & Querying, I have created a simple API for a dataset.

This project provides an API for two dataset: Galway City Beaches and Bathing Water Compliance.

Both datasets are available at:

1. [Galway City Beaches](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/galway-city-beaches)

2. [Bathing Water Compliance](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/bathing-water-compliance)

For reference, I have attached the following files:
* ```Galway_City_Beaches.csv```
* ```BWPR00198_2013_01_profile.pdf```
* ```BWPR00217_2013_01_profile.pdf```
* ```BWPR00265_2014_01_profile.pdf```
